// Q10: Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write 
// because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence
//  describing what the program does.
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
// ADDITION
console.log(`${x}+${y}\=${x + y}`);
// SUBTRACTION
console.log(`${x}-${y}\=${x - y}`);
// MULTILICATION
console.log(`${x}*${y}\=${x * y}`);
// DIVISION
console.log(`${x}/${y}\=${x / y}`);
